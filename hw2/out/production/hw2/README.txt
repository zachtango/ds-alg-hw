The problems that required coding are in the com package folder
    problem 3.21 corresponds to package com.three_twoone
    problem 4.26 corresponds to package com.four_twosix
        For this problem, I didn't write a full AvlTree class because that wasn't the scope of it. The scope was to
        write double rotation functions for an AVL Tree without using two single rotations.
        I created Tree Nodes and connected them in a way that would be where the double rotation functions would be used
        to test the double rotation functions
    problem 4.37 corresponds to package com.four_threeseven
    problem 5.3 corresponds to package com.five_three
    problem 5.5 corresponds to package com.five_five
